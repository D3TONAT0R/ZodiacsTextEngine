# ZodiacsTextEngine

The ZodiacsTextEngine is a simple library for creating text adventures, originally created for the game [Sailing Zodiacs](https://dukeofoool.itch.io/sailing-zodiacs).

Stories are written in a custom text format, intended to be easy to write, needing only minimal amounts of special characters. The engine can be integrated into any .NET application, ranging from simple console or GUI applications to game engines like Unity.
