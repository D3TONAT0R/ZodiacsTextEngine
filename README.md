# ZodiacsTextEngine

The ZodiacsTextEngine is a simple library for creating text adventures, originally created for the game [Sailing Zodiacs](https://dukeofoool.itch.io/sailing-zodiacs).

Content for the game is written using a custom text format, intended to be easy to write, needing only minimal amounts of special characters. The engine comes with a basic console application, *ZodiacsTextConsole*, that can load and play stories written using the engine.

The ZodiacsTextEngine can also be integrated into any .NET application, ranging from simple console or GUI applications to game engines like Unity.
