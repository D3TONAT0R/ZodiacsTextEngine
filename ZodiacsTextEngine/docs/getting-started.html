        <h1>Getting Started</h1>
        <h2 id="prerequisites">Prerequisites</h2>
        <p>To get started writing your story using the provided console application, you will need:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>A text editor for writing your story.</li>
            <li>A copy of the ZodiacsTextEngine console application, <i>ZodiacsTextConsole</i>.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>If you intend to the engine into another environment, you'll also need:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>An IDE capable of creating .NET applications, such as Visual Studio, Visual Studio Code,
                or JetBrains Rider.</li>
            <li>The ZodiacsTextEngine package.</li>
            <li>A .NET project to integrate the ZodiacsTextEngine into.</li>
        </ul>
        <div class="remark">
            For more information how to setup the engine in a .NET project, refer to <a href="library-usage.html">Using
                ZodiacsTextEngine in a custom Application</a>.
        </div>
        <h2 id="using-zodiacstextconsole">Using <i>ZodiacsTextConsole</i></h2>
        <p>
            The ZodiacsTextConsole is a pre-built console application that allows you to load and play
            ZodiacsTextEngine stories with ease.
        </p>
        <p>
            There are two ways in which <i>ZodiacsTextConsole</i> can be used:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Directly loading a story and starting it.</li>
            <li>Launching the main menu to select a story to play.</li>
        </ul>
        <div class="remark">
            Both methods additionally support the <code>--debug</code> command line argument
            to launch the text engine in debug mode, printing additional debug information
            about the story being played.
        </div>

        <h3>Direct Loading</h3>
        <p>
            To load a story, the executable can be run with the <code>--content</code> command line argument,
            followed by the path to the story, which can be either a directory or a zip file.
        </p>
        <p>
            File paths can be either absolute or relative relative to the executable.
        </p>
        <p>Example: <code>ZodiacsTextConsole.exe --content "C:/Path/To/Your/Story/content"</code></p>
        <h3>Main Menu</h3>
        <p>
            To launch the main menu, the executable needs to be run with the <code>--menu</code>
            command line argument.
        </p>
        <p>
            The main menu will list all available stories placed in the <code>stories</code>
            subdirectory below the executable.
        </p>

        <h2 id="writing-stories">Writing Stories</h2>
        <p>
            The ZodiacsTextEngine follows a file structure where each section is defined in its own file
            (called a <i>room</i>).
            The engine runs through the content of a room file sequentially, executing effects and displaying text until
            the end, where it awaits user input. Depending on user input, the story can branch into different rooms,
            execute other effects (e.g. adding an item to the player's inventory), or simply provide flavor text.
        </p>
        <p>
            By default, the engine uses a file named <code>start.room</code>
            as the starting point for the story.
        </p>
        <p>The folder structure for a story may look like this:</p>
        <div class="file-structure">
            <div class="folder">Game Directory
                <div class="file">game.exe</div>
                <div class="folder">content
                    <div class="file"><em>start.room</em></div>
                    <div class="file">entrance.room</div>
                    <div class="file">hallway.room</div>
                    <div class="folder">dungeon
                        <div class="file">dungeon_entrance.room</div>
                        <div class="file">dungeon_trap.room</div>
                    </div>
                    <div class="file">custom_functions.funcs</div>
                    <div class="file">...</div>
                </div>
            </div>
        </div>
        <div class="remark">
            The required file structure and name of the start room can be customized when writing a custom application.
        </div>
        <p>
            Room files can be grouped into subfolders without restrictions,
            the subfolders have no effect on how the room files are processed.
        </p>
        <p>
            See <a href="room-files.html">Room File Structure</a> for detailed information on how to write room files.
