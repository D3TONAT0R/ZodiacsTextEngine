        <h1>Getting Started</h1>
        <h2 id="prerequisites">Prerequisites</h2>
        <p>To get started writing your story using the provided console application, you will need:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>A text editor for writing your story.</li>
            <li>A copy of the ZodiacsTextEngine console application.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>If you intend to write custom functions or integrate it into another environment, you'll also need:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>An IDE capable of creating .NET applications, such as Visual Studio, Visual Studio Code, or JetBrains
                Rider.</li>
            <li>A copy of the ZodiacsTextEngine package.</li>
            <li>A .NET project to integrate the ZodiacsTextEngine into.</li>
        </ul>
        <div class="remark">
            For more information how to setup the engine in a .NET project, refer to <a href="library-usage.html">Using
                ZodiacsTextEngine in a custom Application</a>.
        </div>
        <h2 id="writing-content">Writing Content</h2>
        <p>
            When using the provided console application, the game content files need to be placed in a folder named
            <code>content</code> next to the executable.
        </p>
        <p>
            The ZodiacsTextEngine follows a file structure where each section is defined in its own file (called a
            "room").
            The engine runs through the content of a room file sequentially, executing effects and displaying text until
            the end, where it awaits user input. Depending on user input, the story can branch into different rooms,
            execute other effects (e.g. adding an item to the player's inventory), or simply provide flavour text.
        </p>
        <p>
            By default, the ZodiacsTextEngine uses the file named <code>start.room</code> as the starting point for the
            game.
        </p>
        <p>The folder structure can look like this:</p>
        <div class="file-structure">
            <div class="folder">Game Directory
                <div class="file">game.exe</div>
                <div class="folder">content
                    <div class="file"><em>start.room</em></div>
                    <div class="file">entrance.room</div>
                    <div class="file">hallway.room</div>
                    <div class="folder">dungeon
                        <div class="file">dungeon_entrance.room</div>
                        <div class="file">dungeon_trap.room</div>
                    </div>
                    <div class="file">...</div>
                </div>
            </div>
        </div>
        <div class="remark">
            The required file structure and name of the start room can be customized when writing a custom application.
        </div>
        <p>
            Room files can be grouped into subfolders without restrictions,
            the subfolders have no effect on how the room files are processed.
        </p>
        <p>
            See <a href="room-files.html">Room File Structure</a> for detailed information on how to write room files.
